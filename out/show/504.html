            <p>Batman Beyond tells the story of Terry McGinnis was just an ordinary teenager...until his father was
                mysteriously murdered. Suspecting foul play at his father&#x27;s company Wayne/Powers Corporation, Terry
                meets Bruce Wayne and learns a secret identity hidden for decades. Now too old to battle injustice,
                Wayne is a bitter shell of his former self and refuses to help. So Terry does what any brash young kid
                would do: steal the Batsuit and take matters into his own hands! Vowing to avenge his father&#x27;s
                death, Terry dons the high-tech suit - tricked out with jetpacks for flying, a supersensitive microphone
                for eavesdropping and even camouflage capabilities - in search of his father&#x27;s assassin.</p><img
